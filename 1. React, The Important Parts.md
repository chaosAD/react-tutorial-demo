<h2 id="react-components">React Components</h2>

React uses **components** to organize complex websites into **small bits of code**. The <u>src/App.js</u> file that we previously edited was a React component.

```jsx
/* HelloWorld.js */

// 1.
import React from "react";

// 2.
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  // 3.
  render() {
    return <p>Hello World</p>
  }
}

// 4.
export default HelloWorld;
```

`HelloWorld` is also a React component. React components are JavaScript classes. JavaScript classes are no different from Java classes except that you don't need special modifiers such as `public` and types such as `int` before declaring things. There are some general rules that you must follow for React components.

- Firstly,  **every React should must extend the `React.Component` class**. If you don't, you'll get some nasty errors in your code. Extending  `React.Component` tells React that your class is not any ordinary JavaScript class‚Äîit's a React component.
- Secondly, **every React should must`import "react"`**. This follows the first rule‚Äîyou need to import React to extend it's component class.
- Thirdly, **every React component should have a `render()` method**. This tells React what to show the user when the component is used.
- Lastly, **every file have the same name as it's React class**, just like a Java class. Additionally, Every file should also `export default` their class. Should you want to import the component from another class, you need to make it easily accessible.

###Components for Dummies ü§™

Every React component is a JavaScript class contained in a single file. Let's take a look at an example.

```react
class Date extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const year = new Date().getFullYear();
    return <p>It's {year}!</p>
  }
}
```

Notice how our `Date` component extends the `React.Component` class. React components, as we went over, we **must** do this. Also notice how our class again has a  `render()` that returns some HTML-like syntax. In React, the `render()` method is expected to return the *view* of a component class. 

The *view* of a component is the code for what the user is able to see. It's basically the HTML that's attached to the component in question. In this instance, our view is "It's 2019!" because that's what the user would see if we used this component.

Ok, things are starting to make sense, but something's still odd here. Why is there HTML-like text inside of our JavaScript anyway? Aren't HTML and JavaScript two seperate langauges. To answer how this works, you must a understand special syntax called **JSX**.

####JSX in Plain English

JSX is a HTML-like language that React uses to create React components and HTML elements. It's basically a fancy way of creating HTML elements and new React components in JavaScript, nothing more. React developers use JSX because it's more readable than writing JavaScript.

```jsx
// This JSX represents a paragraph element with "It's 2019" inside.
<p>It's {new Date().getFullYear()}!</p>
```

The above JSX is actually the exact same thing as...

```jsx
// Returns a paragraph element with "It's 2019" inside.
React.createElement("p", null, "It's "+ new Date().getFullYear() + "!");
```

One handy feature that JSX has is that it lets you insert or "interpolate" JavaScript expressions into elements with curly braces.

```jsx
// We use curly braces to insert or "interpolate" expressions.
<p>It's {new Date().getFullYear()}!</p>
```

In this example,  the `new Date().getFullYear()` expression returns the current year as a number, which is then casted into a string by React and displayed.

*P.S. Don't accidentally interpolate statements. Only valid [expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18443801/in-programming-what-is-an-expression) are permitted!.*

```jsx
// ‚õîÔ∏è You can't do this! "if" statements are not expressions.
<p>You { if (age < 21) { return "can't"; } return "can"; } legally drink!</p>
```

To make this code work as intended, you can replace the "if" statements with a ternary operator.

```jsx
// ‚úÖ Ternary operators are expressions.
<p>You { age < 21 ? "can't" : "can" } legally drink!</p>
```

###The Component Tree üå¥

Components are cool, but what if components could contain other components? React allows us to **nest** components, just like HTML. This creates a "tree" like data structure‚Äîcomponents with other components as children.

```react
// Import components and "React" as needed.
import React from "react";
import NavigationBar from "./NavigationBar.js";
import MainContainer from "./MainContainer.js";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <NavigationBar />
        <MainContainer />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Export every component so that other components can import them.
export default App;
```

Notice how our JSX contains a mixture of HTML and React components. `div` is and HTML element while `NavigationBar` and `MainContainer` are both React components. This is intentional‚Äîget used to thinking of the React components that you create as ordinary HTML elements that you can import.

Don't get too clever with nesting components. Each component or element can nested multiple component or elements, but each component definition can only contain one element.

```jsx
// ‚õîÔ∏è This will give us some nasty errors. This components definition has multiple components.
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <NavigationBar />
        <MainContainer />
      	<div>Test</div>
    );
  }
}
```

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div> {/* ‚úÖ We absolutely need this div! Now our component definition only has one element. */}
        <NavigationBar />
        <MainContainer />
        <div>Test</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

<h2 id="state">State </h2>

In React, **state** is the smallest amount of information that a component needs to `render()` a view correctly. Notice how I italicized *minimum*. It's important that we keep our state as small as possible. Let's work through some examples!

Consider a todo application. More specifically, consider the minimum amound of information that your might need to make one. You'll likely need:

- A list of items `[]`
- Some indication of each item's completion `{ completed: true, name: "Sell concert tickets." }`

A **state object** for a todo application might look like...

```javascript
state = {
  items: [
    { completed: false, name: "Actually do my homework." },
    { completed: true, name: "Sell concert tickets." }
  ]
};
```

Notice how small this state object is. It's very clear what information the state object conveys here‚Äîa list of items, each with two properties, `completed` and `name`. This state object works well because it communicates the smallest amount of information that a component might need to know to render a view.

####What is this syntax?

In JavaScript, curly brackets  `{}`  and colons  `:`  are part of the [syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp) for defining properties and values for objects. In the example above, our `state` object has an `items` property which contains an array of objects each containing `completed` and `name` properties.

###Adding "State" to our View

In React, each component has it's own **state object**.

```jsx
/* TodoApp.js */
import React from "react";

class TodoApp extends React.Component {
 	// State object
  state = {
    items: [
      { completed: false, name: "Actually do my homework." },
      { completed: true, name: "Sell concert tickets." }
    ]
  };
	
  render() {
    // Access the state object using "this." syntax, just like Java.
    return <div>You have {this.state.items.length} todo items.</div>;
  }
}

export default TodoApp;
```

In React, each component also has a `render()` method. This is the most React's most critical symbiosis. This separation works well because as we *modify* our `state` object , we don't need to change our `render()` method‚ÄîReact just needs to call the `render()` method with fresh values. 

I'll go into more detail about how to *modify* the `state` in React in response to user action in the [Interaction and Events](#interaction-and-events) section.

#### Rendering state objects

Let's modify our `render()` method to render the todo items in our `state  `object.

```jsx
import React from "react";

class TodoApp extends React.Component {
  state = {
    items: [
      { completed: false, name: "Actually do my homework." },
      { completed: true, name: "Sell concert tickets." }
    ]
  };
	
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {
          this.state.items.map((item, index) => {
            return <p>
              {item.name} ¬∑ {item.completed ? "Completed" : "Not Completed"}
            </p>;
          })
        }
      </div>
  	);
  }
}

export default TodoApp;
```

Here we're iteratirng through a list of items in our state object and returning a list of `p` elements containing their names and their completion status. We can't use a for-loop here because for-loops are statements, and JSX only accepts expressions. This means that we need a way to iterate through items using some structure that returns a value. Luckily, JavaScript has a means of doing this‚Äîthe `map` array method. 

#### `map` all of the things

Every JavaScript array has a `map` method on it. The `map ` method takes a one function as an argument and calls that function on every value in the array that we call it on.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 5, 6, 2];

/* 
  `map` calls the function on every array item...
  it calls each item with items value as the first
  argument and it's index as the second.
  
  ourFunction(value, index)
  
	calling `map` looks a lot like this internally...
	
   - ourFunction (1, 0) => 1
   - ourFunction (5, 1) => 25
   - ourFunction (6, 2) => 36
   - ourFunction (4, 3) => 4
   
   and returns a combined list of results as an array...
   - [1, 25, 36, 4]
 */
let squaredNumbers = numbers.map((number, numberIndex) => {
  return number * number;
});
```

The `map` method calls the function that we pass on every single array element and returns a new array filled with the new return values in the order that they were in the original array.

When we call the `map` method here, we're looping through every item in the `items` property of our `state` and returning a paragraph element. Returning the pargraph element works here because JSX elements are objects.

```jsx
let foods = ["pho", "corn", "broccoli"];

/* 
	ourFunction(value, index)
	
	calling `map` looks a lot like this internally...
	
   - ourFunction ("pho", 0) => <li>pho</li>
   - ourFunction ("corn", 1) => <li>corn</li>
   - ourFunction ("brocolli", 2) => <li>broccoli</li>
   
   and returns a combined list of results as an array...
   - [
   -   <li>pho</li>,
   -   <li>corn</li>,
   -   <li>broccoli</li>
   - ]
 */
let foodElements = foods.map((food, foodIndex) => {
  return <li>{food}</li>;
});
```

Now we know how to format our component `state`into a nicely formatted view for the user.

### Homework

Play around with this! Edit the `state` object to make it your own and try rendering it with all different [HTML elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) that you've learned about!

That's it for this week!
